Project Description

This project is an implementation of a self-driving car using deep neural networks and IoT devices. The car is equipped with a Raspicam 5mp camera that captures real-time images of the road. The images are processed using OpenCV, machine learning, and deep neural networks to detect road lanes, traffic lights, and signs. The detected objects are then tracked in real-time, and the car's movements are adjusted accordingly.

The project is implemented on Raspberry Pi, Microcontroller Raspicam 5mp, ArdinoUno, and programmed in C++. The car's movements are controlled by 4 DC motors, which are connected to the microcontroller. The microcontroller communicates with the Raspberry Pi using a serial communication protocol.

In summary, this project is an innovative application of deep neural networks and IoT devices to automate driving for the elderly and handicapped. The project has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry and improve the lives of millions of people worldwide.
